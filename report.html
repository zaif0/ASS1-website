                    To start off I’d like to say that Html and CSS must be the most simple and fun languages I’ve ever done. I picked up on it really well thanks to Chris for explaining everything in detail and building my base to start this website off. After a few lectures I started to get a hang of how to code Html and CSS and it was quite fun building this website, keep in mind I was absolutely terrified of designing a full functioning website all on my own at the start of this semester. Usually with any new subject I learn I get annoyed and bored of the learning process, but this one was different, and I believe I’ve found something I love doing now. Now talking about my website and why I chose the design I’ve been developing over the past few weeks (All links to websites I used for fonts/colors etc... will be listed at the end of this page). I picked different shades of blue as it is my favorite color, and I think I made the right decision because the website looks awesome. As for the fonts, I just scrolled through google fonts until I found the one I liked most. I kept the overall design of the website minimalistic so that there wasn’t any extra text. I added a custom logo on my main page which I made from Wix. I feel that for my first ever attempt at making a website I’ve done a wonderful job, and I am really proud of my work.
