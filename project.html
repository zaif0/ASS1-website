            <h3>Arduino uno</h3>
            <p>I won my high school science fair by building an Arduino Uno-powered line-following car. Using IR sensors, it detected and followed a black tape path autonomously. Overcoming challenges with sensor calibration and motor control, I successfully created a working prototype, sparking my passion for AI, robotics, and automation.</p>

            <h3>Valorant</h3>
            <p>I reached Immortal in Valorant, standing among the top players and earning recognition from pro players for my mechanics and game sense. I constantly analyze strategies, adapt to the evolving meta, and refine my skills, pushing myself to compete at the highest level in esports.</p>

            <h3>Foundation year assignment</h3>
            <p>For my foundation assignment, I fully edited a video documentary, managing everything from cutting footage to adding effects and transitions. I also had screen time in the documentary, showcasing my involvement both behind and in front of the camera. My effort and attention to detail earned me an A grade.</p>

            <h3>Modified RC car</h3>
            <p>As a kid, I modified an RC car to reach 80 km/h by upgrading its motor, battery, and gears. Experimenting with different setups, I fine-tuned its speed and control, making it faster than ever. It was all about pushing limits and having fun with drive.</p>
